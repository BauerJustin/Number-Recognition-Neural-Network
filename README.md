# Number-Recognition-Neural-Network
Neural Network to recognize written numbers using MATLAB/Octave (Summer 2020).

## Run Instructions
Download all the files and run the `main.m` in MATLAB or Octave. Follow program commands.

## Disclaimer
The scripts are based on the third lab from [Stanford's Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). The `data.mat` and `weights.mat` files are provided from the course as well as the code this project is based on. I modified the `main.m` file to present the information clearly to the user and during the lab I created the neural network in the `network.m` file (file names have changed from what was provided in the course). The `sigmoid.m` and `displayData.m` files are from the course and virtually unmodified.
